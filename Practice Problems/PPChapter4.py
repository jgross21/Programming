# The Grerory-Leibnitz series approximates pi as 4 ∗ (1/1 − 1/3 + 1/5 − 1/7 + 1/9...).
# Write code that prints the approximation of pi according to this series.

# The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers that starts with 1, followed by 1 again.
# Every next number is the sum of the two previous numbers.
# I.e., the sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,...
# Write a program that calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence
# until the numbers get higher than 1000.

# You can solve quadratic equations using the quadratic formula.
# Quadratic equations are of the form Ax2 + Bx + C = 0.
# Such equations have zero, one or two solutions.
# The first solution is (−B + sqrt(B^22 − 4AC))/(2A).
# The second solution is (−B − sqrt(B^2 − 4AC))/(2A).
# There are no solutions if the value under the square root is negative.
# There is one solution if the value under the square root is zero.
# Write a program that asks the user for the values of A, B, and C,
# then reports whether there are zero, one, or two solutions,
# then prints those solutions.
# Note: Make sure that you also take into account the case that A is zero,
# and the case that both A and B are zero.

#Write code that classifies a given amount of money (which you store in a variable named count),
# as greater monetary units. Your code lists the monetary equivalent in dollars, quarters,
# dimes, nickels, and pennies.
# Your program should report the maximum number of dollars that fit in the amount,
# then the maximum number of quarters that fit in the remainder after you subtract the dollars,
# then the maximum number of dimes that fit in the remainder after you subtract the dollars and quarters,
# and so on for nickels and pennies.
# The result is that you express the amount as the minimum number of coins needed.
