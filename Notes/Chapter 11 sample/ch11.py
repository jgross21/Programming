FOLDERS
If we use external images, sound, or files, we must use folders.

BLITTING TEXT (REVIEW):
Recall the 3 step process to add text...
Set font, render text, blit text (let's try this out)

my_font = pygame.font.SysFont('font', font_size, bold, italic) #creates usable object named my_font
my_text = my_font.render(string_to_display, anti_alias, color) #creates a rendered graphical object my_text
screen.blit(my_text,[x, y]) #places rendered image on screen

BACKGROUND IMAGES:
# This line loads the image (location of your image must be in same folder)
pygame.image.load("specific_name_of_file.jpg")

# This loads the image 
# AND creates a usable object called background_image (or whatever you want to call it)
background_image = pygame.image.load("specific_name_of_file.jpg")
^^^THIS^^^ line needs to be OUTSIDE THE LOOP

# THis line blits the image to the screen.
screen.blit(background_image, [0, 0])
^^^THIS^^^ line needs to be INSIDE THE LOOP

For backgrounds, jpegs are fine.
Let's add the file

MOVING IMAGES:
Now lets use the same process to load a dragon
Now let's move him with the mouse

ADDING SOUND:
my_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("file_name")
^^^THIS^^^ must come after pygame.init()
my_sound.play() # plays the sound object

    # Go ahead and update the screen with what we've drawn.
    # This MUST happen after all the other drawing commands.

    # This limits the while loop to a max of 60 times per second.
    # Leave this out and we will use all CPU we can.
